# NLP_SentimentAnalysis
 This project performs a sentiment analysis task on hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing customer reviews, we can gain information on the overall sentiment of hotel guests. Using that information we can build a model that accurately predicts the sentiment of hotel reviews. This could be helpful for hotel management to understand guest satisfaction and areas for improvement, thereby improving customer service and experience.

We will be using the TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/qusaybtoush1990/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews/input), which contains thousands of user reviews along with ratings. Each review is accompanied by a sentiment label.
